# My Portfolio Website

A minimalistic website to showcase my work. Designed with Figma and implemented using React, Sass, and Flask. Check it out <a href="https://alexhom.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.

**Note**: Right now, the website is best viewed on desktop browsers because it isn't responsive yet. However, I am currently working on making it responsive, so it will look good on smartphones and tablets soon.
