                    I am a computer science student who is passionate about UI/UX and full stack web development. In my free time, I enjoy designing and coding up websites. My current tech stack in 2022 consists of React and Flask. In addition to making websites, I also enjoy coding in general. Python, JavaScript, and C++ are among my favorite programming languages. Other topics I am interested in are operating systems and computer networks.
